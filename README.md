<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>Flip a fair coin 100 timesâ€”it gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?</p>&mdash; Daniel Litt (@littmath) <a href='https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1769044719034647001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>March 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
